# js1k


Great js1k demos port to clojure and clojurescript, for 2013 lisp in summer projects.

Now just has three demos, two in the love theme of 2013, another in the prelude theme of 2010,

add other demos or themes is easy, just look in the code. 

The codes are not well writen, i am a beginner to Clojure, pleased to see any feedback.



ClojureScript demo:

Clojure demo has a standalone jar to be download.
