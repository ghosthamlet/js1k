# js1k


Great js1k demos port to Clojure and Clojurescript, for 2013 lisp in summer projects.

Now just has three demos, two in the love theme of 2013, another in the prelude theme of 2010,

add other demos or themes is easy, just look in the code. 

I am a beginner to Clojure, The codes are not well writen, but playable, 
and still have some problems:

1. I haven't found an easy way to create water reflection in Clojure version
2. Clojurescript version has some performance problems, but some times the same codes build has quite different performance, it's strange.
3. The rose demo of All version have no 3D animation

I am pleased to see any feedback, and new demos.


ClojureScript demo:

Clojure demo has a standalone jar to be download.
